# Budget Calculator App
Budget Calculator App adapted from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU4z4Ti-8OQ" target="_blank">Devstackr Tutorial</a>

This app is designed to calculate the total budget of a user, using a list of their incomes and expenditures.

The user can add items to their list, inputting a small description of their item; amount spent/saved and the quantity of that item. 
The app will add this item to the appropriate list in addition to adding the amount of that item to the total amount.
The user should add a '-' to the beginning of an item to indicate an expenditure.

By clicking on an item featured in the list the user can edit the details of an item. Once saved the item information as well as total amount will update.
Users are also able to remove an item by hovering over an item and clicking on the 'x' icon.
