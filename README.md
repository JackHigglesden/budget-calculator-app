# Budget Calculator App
Budget Calculator App based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU4z4Ti-8OQ" target="_blank">Devstackr Tutorial</a>

This project was created using Angular and designed to further my knowledge of Typescript.
I have used this project to also further my knowledge of the bulma css framework aswell as the BEM methodology

Items Complete (Added Functionality):
* Add Quantity functionality
* Make Mobile Friendly by applying media queries
* Convert files to BEM methodology
* Change color variable names to be more in sync with their uses in the app   
* Add in functionality to remove income and expense titles on UI when no items currently exist

To Do:

* Have the ability to add only the income column title if only income items have been added (Also apply to expense)
* Adding animation to total amount bar showing the addition of income to the total amount
